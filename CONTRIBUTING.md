_Key Directories and Files_

- `js/commands/`: The folder where you can add or modify terminal commands
- `js/filesystem.js`: This is where you edit the virtual file system
- `js/commands/registry.js`: The place to register new commands for the terminal to recognize

Familiarizing yourself with this layout will help you make more effective contributions.
