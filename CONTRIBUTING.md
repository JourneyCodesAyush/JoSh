_Key Directories and Files_

- `js/commands/`: The folder where you can add or modify terminal commands
- `js/filesystem.js`: This is where you edit the virtual file system
- `js/commands/registry.js`: The place to register new commands for the terminal to recognize

Familiarizing yourself with this layout will help you make more effective contributions.

### 2. Fork the Repository

Click the **Fork** button at the top right of the repository page to create your own copy.

### 3. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/journeycodesayush/josh.git
cd josh
```

### 4. Create a New Branch

Create a feature or fix branch based on the change you're making:

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

Use a descriptive name: `fix/prompt-glitch`, `docs/update-readme`, etc.

### 5. Make Your Changes

- Add or improve commands
- Fix bugs or UI issues
- Customize or enhance the virtual file system
- Update documentation

Make sure your changes follow the existing structure and are linted.

### 6. Commit Your Changes (Angular Commit Message Format)

All commits to **JoSh** must follow the **Angular Commit Message Format**.
This helps maintain a clear project history and enables automated changelog generation.

Each commit consists of three parts:

```text
<header> <body> <footer>
```

- `<header>` is mandatory
- Keep the `<header>` â‰¤ 72 characters
- `<body>` is mandatory for all commits except docs and must be at least 20 characters
- `<footer>` is optional

**Commit Header**

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
```

- **type** (required): one of:

  | Type       | Description (Scope examples: command, ui, readme)     |
  | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | `feat`     | A new feature                                         |
  | `fix`      | A bug fix                                             |
  | `docs`     | Changes to documentation only                         |
  | `style`    | Code formatting changes (no logic impact)             |
  | `refactor` | Code improvements that don't fix bugs or add features |
  | `test`     | Adding or modifying tests                             |
  | `chore`    | Routine tasks, build scripts, config changes          |
  | `ci`       | Changes to CI configuration                           |
  | `perf`     | Performance improvement                               |
  | `build`    | Changes that affect build system or dependencies      |

- **scope** (optional): the part of the codebase affected.

  For JoSh, suggested scopes:

  ```nginx
  ui | commands | filesystem | registry | docs | tests
  ```

- **summary** (required): short imperative description, no capitalization, no period

#### Examples

```bash
feat(command): add weather command
fix(ui): correct prompt cursor alignment
docs: update usage instructions in README
```

#### Commit Body

- Explain **why** the change was made
- Compare previous behavior with the new behavior
- Use imperative, present tense
- Must be at least **20 characters** (except `docs`)

#### Example

```bash
add new weather command to terminal
allows users to fetch current weather by city name
```

#### Commit Footer

- Use for **breaking changes, deprecations, or GitHub issues**

#### Example

```md
BREAKING CHANGE: terminal prompt logic updated

previous prompt handling relied on global state
update scripts to use new prompt API

Fixes #42
```

```md
DEPRECATED: old cat command

replaced by new cat command supporting directories
Closes #99
```

```md
revert: feat(commands): add weather command

This reverts commit ab12cd34ef56.
Reason: new command caused conflicts with existing commands
```

#### âœ¨ Commit Formatting Tips

- Wrap body lines at ~72 characters
- Use imperative, present tense: "add feature", not "added feature"
- Be concise but descriptive

### 7. Push Your Branch

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

### 8. Open a Pull Request

Go to the original repo and open a **Pull Request** from your forked branch.
Provide a clear description of what you changed and why.
