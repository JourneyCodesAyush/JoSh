A terminal-style portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.  
Inspired by [evilprince2009.github.io](https://github.com/evilprince2009/evilprince2009.github.io), this project brings the retro charm of a command-line interface to your personal website.

> ⚠️ **Note**: This portfolio currently supports only desktop view (no mobile responsiveness yet).

## 🛠️ Getting started

### Run Locally

You can simply open `index.html` in your browser — no server required.

Once running, you'll be greeted with a terminal-like interface. Try typing help or man to get started!

---

| File            | Purpose                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `fileSystem.js` | Add your data here to customize    |
| `manuals.js`    | Customize `man` pages              |
| `style.css`     | Tweak the appearance & colors      |
| `main.js`       | Set welcome message & prompt style |

You can also:

- Add new commands inside `js/commands/` and register them in `registry.js`.
- Modify the virtual file system for your own content.

---

## 🔧 Customizing Your Fork

Feel free to fork this repo and make it your own! Here are some quick tips to get started:

- 📁 **Customize your portfolio content** by editing the `fileSystem.js` file — this is where you add your personal files and structure.

- 🛠️ **Add new commands** by creating JavaScript files inside the `js/commands/` folder, then register them in `registry.js`.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Guide

- Keep command logic modular (`one file = one command`)
- Use `registry.js` to register all commands
- Follow the Unix philosophy: do one thing, do it well
